`Job Offer Bot` allows you to post your job offers via simple and intuitive messages via Telegram.

You'll have the ability to send your job offer to a single group or in multiple ones, the **chose** is yours!

## Why this bot exist

The bot is and idea of the [Lavoro Digitale Italia](https://lavorodigitaleitalia.it/) communities manager and leadership.

The wanted something useful for them to easily post `job offers` in telegram communities simplifying the way of writing the messages
following different templates.

They wanted to keep the bot open source, to follow the spirit of the tech communities and the work every of us is doing.

## Usage of the bot

In order to be able to use the bot, you just have to add it to your group with `admin` rights.

Then you just have to send the `/start` command, and you're done!

You'll have the abilities to use different commands, you can have more info using `/commands` and `/help`.

## How it works

The idea is pretty simple, every time the bot is initialized inside a group, it will store the data required
to send messages inside that group, such as the `topic id` and the language of the message (defaults to Italian).

Everything else is just stored on the fly, called `session` in [grammY](https://www.grammy.dev) framework.

**IMPORTANT**

The _job offers_ you're sending, **are not stored anywhere**, that means that once it was sent to a group or groups, you'll not able to edit it.
